                    My name is Gabriel Øgård and I am a Fullstack Software Engineer with a
                    BSc Degree in IT (Specialization in Frontend and Mobile Development).
                    I <strong>love</strong> to write code and learn new techniques to solving problems.
                    Most of the projects I am currently working on contain some aspect of Kotlin for Backend (or Mobile app)
                    and / or some form of JavaScript framework written in TypeScript for the Frontend / Web side of things.
                </p>
            </div>
    );
